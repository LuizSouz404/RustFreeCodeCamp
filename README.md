**Note:** To run the CLI, we need to be in the root of the specific project.

**Calculator:** The project adds only two numbers. To test the CLI, use the command:

```bash
cargo run -- (number) (operator) (number)
```

Mapped operators:

- (+) Addition
- (-) Subtraction
- (*) Multiplication
- (/) Division

**Image Combiner:** The project combines two images by blending their RGBA values. To test the CLI, use the command:

```bash
cargo run -- (path of image 1) (path of image 2) (path of the output combined image)
```
